# Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting

## Section Description:
Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.
In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.

## Discussion:
Nice mini project to explore how the box model works, along with an introduction to border-radius and filters: blur(), which are common concepts in modern web design.
