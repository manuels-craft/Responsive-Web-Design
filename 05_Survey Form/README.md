# Survey Form

## Section Description:
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.
For this project, you will build a survey form to collect data from your users.

## Discussion:
I believe this project was an excellent way to put into practice everything covered in the last four lessons of the course. Coming right after "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form", it served as a great opportunity to apply those concepts in a more independent way.

For a new developer, this challenge offers the chance to try building a form without constantly relying on references, which is a good test of how much knowledge has actually been retained. Itâ€™s a solid step toward building confidence and reinforcing what is been learned through repetition and real implementation.
