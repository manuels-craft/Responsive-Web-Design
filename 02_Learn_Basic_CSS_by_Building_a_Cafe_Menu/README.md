## Discussion:
Very beginner-friendly project, great for those just starting with CSS. It reminded me of when I was building small projects to break into tech. At that time, HTML and CSS were all I needed. I focused on what I could learn, even if I didnâ€™t understand all the programming concepts yet, and that patience paid off.
