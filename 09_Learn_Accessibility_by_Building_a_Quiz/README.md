# Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz

## Section Description:
Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to use â€“ even people with disabilities.
In this course, you'll build a quiz webpage. You'll learn accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.
## Discussion:
Accessibility is one of my favorite topics as a web developer. Even though freeCodeCamp.org decided to keep it simple, I believe it has great value for new developers and can make a huge difference when delivering a basic website.
