# Responsive Web Design

I'm currently going through the Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp.org

Even though I already know HTML and CSS, I set a goal for this year to get officially certified in the technologies I use. I'm a self-taught developer with over 10 years of experience, and most of my knowledge has come from trial and error, tutorials, real-life projects, and challenges I've faced at work. I’ve learned a lot through books, hands-on experience, and constantly staying curious. Until now, I haven’t needed a degree to build a career in tech — it’s been my passion and self-discipline that got me here. This certification is part of my commitment to keep growing, sharpening my skills, and proving to myself (and others) that I’m always leveling up.

The projects in this certification start with the basics and gradually move into topics like accessibility, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive layouts — all essential for building solid, modern websites. I believe it's important to go through every topic — not only to refresh what I already know or pick up something new, but also to keep building discipline and staying committed. It's the same mindset I've followed since I began my career as a web developer over 10 years ago. I never overlook any part of the development process, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem to others. I believe there's real power in the smallest details. When I look at fully scaled projects in my current work environment — whether it's micro frontends or microservices — it's clear that success comes from getting countless little things right, consistently, over time. 

There's a pattern I’ve noticed in most programming books. They either teach you the foundational knowledge you need to learn a technology, or they assume you already have it. If you try to push through a book without that foundation, it can feel unhelpful — but that's not the book's fault. I’ve come across many negative reviews for books, but when I read them myself, I often find value others missed. In many cases, the issue isn’t the book — it’s that the reader lacked the background knowledge or simply had different preferences.
