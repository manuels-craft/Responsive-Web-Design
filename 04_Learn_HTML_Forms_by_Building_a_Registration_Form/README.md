## Discussion:
I’d say this form project has been full of surprises. I had no idea it would turn out to be this good. The features implemented here were incredibly detailed, even Regex was covered, though only on the surface.

To my knowledge, no YouTube video dives into the front-end side of forms with this level of depth. Most tutorials rush through the front-end and jump straight into backend functionality or focus only on visual styling.

But this project? It’s the real deal when it comes to front-end form development.

All things considered, this is a solid 10 out of 10.
